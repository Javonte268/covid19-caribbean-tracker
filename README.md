## 💡 Key Insights
Guadeloupe experienced three peak death spikes occurring approximately at the beginning of the last quarter of 2020, the end of the first quarter of 2021, and the biggest one in mid-2021 — likely correlating with the Delta variant wave and its significantly larger population size.  
Antigua and Barbuda ranked second with fewer than 200 deaths, and Saint Kitts and Nevis placed third with fewer than 100 total deaths.  
Places like Saint Martin showed consistently low levels with no major spikes.
